This software is a small JavaScript program that runs in the console and prints a greeting message. It uses a function, loops, and simple text shapes to decorate the output. The program also changes text colors in the console to make the message more interesting.


The purpose of creating this software is to practice JavaScript basics, such as functions, loops, and console output, while adding some creativity with shapes and colors. It also helps demonstrate my understanding of simple programming concepts.
